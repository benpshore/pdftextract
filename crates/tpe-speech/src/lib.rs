//! Text-to-speech for the workbench, validated by speech recognition.
//!
//! Two engines implement [`Tts`]: [`AvSpeech`] (macOS `AVSpeechSynthesizer`,
//! captured to PCM rather than played) and, behind the `kokoro` feature,
//! `Kokoro` (Kokoro-82M ONNX on every OS). [`validate::round_trip`] feeds the
//! synthesized audio to docling's Whisper (feature `asr`) and scores the word
//! error rate. An empty transcript means the synthesis failed. The Objective-C
//! calls live in `tpe_ffi::av_speech` (macOS only).
