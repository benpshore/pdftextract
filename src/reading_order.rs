//! Reading order recovery: positioned spans -> lines -> ordered page text.
//!
//! The backend emits one [`Span`] per string operator in content-stream
//! order, which on multi-column pages is rarely the reading order. This
//! module groups spans into lines by baseline, orders the lines with a
//! recursive XY-cut over their boxes (columns before rows, except that
//! full-width lines at the top or bottom of a region are split off first,
//! that a region is cut into bands at lines bridging its gutter, and that
//! a row gap across the columns is cut first when the line texts read on
//! better by rows) and joins them into `PageText::text`.
//! Coordinates are PDF user space (origin bottom-left, `y` grows upwards).
//! On a page with `/Rotate` 90, 180 or 270 the spans are grouped and
//! ordered in the turned frame the page is displayed in, and the line
//! boxes are turned back into user space. No text repair of any kind is
//! performed.
//!
//! A line bridges the gutter of a two-column region (a figure caption, a
//! table or an equation set across both columns, or a row of the two
//! columns fused into one line) when it runs past the gutter by more than
//! `BRIDGE_REACH` of the region's width on both sides. Such a line blocks
//! every column cut through the region, and the whitespace above and below
//! it is often narrower than a row gap, so the region is first cut into
//! bands where bridging and other lines meet (see [`bridge_row_cut`]):
//! the band above reads left column then right column, then the bridging
//! lines, then the band below.
//!
//! Fonts without precomposed accented letters (`pdfTeX` with the OT1
//! encoding, say) set an accent as a glyph of its own, placed slightly
//! above the letter it belongs to and often shown before that letter. Such
//! an accent span is not a line of its own: it is attached to the line
//! whose glyph it sits over, listed right after that glyph's span, and its
//! spacing accent is composed onto the letter under it as the combining
//! mark it stands for (`Verdu` + acute over the `u` reads `Verdú`). That
//! is a rendering of what the page shows, not a repair of it.
//!
//! `pdfTeX` mostly does not show the accent on its own: when no kern
//! precedes it the accent closes the string of the text before it, and the
//! letter opens the next string after a kern back under the accent
//! (`[(H\177)500(older)]TJ` sets `Hölder`). Such a span ends in an accent
//! glyph and the span under that glyph's tail holds the letter, which is
//! composed the same way once the overlap is confirmed; without a letter
//! under it the span's text is kept as shown.
//!
//! Vertical text (the rotated `arXiv` stamp in the left margin, rotated
//! axis labels) never joins a horizontal line. A span is vertical when it
//! shows at least two glyphs in a box more than `VERTICAL_RATIO` times
//! taller than wide and `VERTICAL_MIN_HEIGHT` sizes tall, or when it is one
//! rotated glyph (a box about as wide as tall) in a run of at least
//! `STACK_MIN` such glyphs stacked in the page margin in content-stream
//! order. Vertical spans are grouped into lines of their own in
//! content-stream order; such a line in the margin band (`MARGIN_FRACTION`
//! of the page width from either edge) is placed after all other lines with
//! a page warning, anywhere else it is ordered like any other line.
//!
//! Spans on a shared baseline in the two columns of a page can end up in
//! one line when the gutter is narrower than `LINE_REACH`. A line whose
//! widest gap is wider than `GUTTER_SPACES` space widths, straddles the
//! vertical midline of the page (or of the text on it) and has at least
//! `GUTTER_WORDS` words on either side is split there. A line wider than
//! `SPANNING_PAGE` of the page (a title, or a fused row of two justified
//! columns) is split only when that gap also covers the gutter the other
//! lines of the page leave open, so a title's stretched word space is kept.
//!
//! A column gutter is often narrowed or crossed by a few lines of the left
//! column that run past its right edge (an overfull line, a protruding
//! hyphen), which leaves no clean vertical whitespace through the region.
//! When no clean column cut exists, up to `OVERHANG_LINES` such lines are
//! tolerated (see [`overhang_column_cut`]); a line centred on the gutter or
//! reaching deep into the right column never is.
//!
//! A page header or footer set as short lines over or under the columns (a
//! running head over one column, the page number over the other) is cut
//! off at the row gap that separates it from the columns before the
//! columns are read (see [`furniture_bands`]), so it does not stand in for
//! the first or last line of a column when the text flow is weighed.
