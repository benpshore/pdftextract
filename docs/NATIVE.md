# Native backends: provisioning

The default build (`cargo build`) has no native dependencies: the `lopdf`
backend is pure Rust. Two optional Cargo features add backends that need
artifacts which are not crates:

| feature | backends | needs at run time |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pdfium` | `pdfium` | the PDFium shared library |
| `docling-text` | `docling-text` | nothing; pure Rust, supervised page parser |
| `docling` (implies `docling-text`, `pdfium`) | `docling-text`, `docling` | `docling`: PDFium, the layout and OCR models, ONNX Runtime; not enabled for supervised CLI extraction |

`native/manifest.json` pins the exact set of artifacts and `native/fetch.sh`
provisions them. The `Native` workflow (`.github/workflows/native.yml`) does the
same in CI.

## What gets provisioned, and where

Paths are relative to the repository root. `fetch.sh` always works from there,
whatever directory you run it from.

| file | source | size |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `.pdfium/lib/libpdfium.so` (Linux) or `.pdfium/lib/libpdfium.dylib` (macOS) | the `lib/` member of `pdfium-<platform>.tgz` from [bblanchon/pdfium-binaries](https://github.com/bblanchon/pdfium-binaries), release `chromium/8066` | not recorded yet (the first run prints it) |
| `.models/layout_heron_int8.onnx` | docling.rs release `models-v1` | about 65 MB |
| `.models/ocr_det.onnx` | docling.rs release `models-v1` | about 9 MB |
| `.models/ocr_rec_en.onnx` | docling.rs release `models-v1` | about 8 MB |
| `.models/en_dict.txt` | docling.rs release `models-v1` | small text file (the first run prints the size) |

The models come to about 82 MB, plus the PDFium library. The model sizes are
approximate, taken from the project's notes on the release. The `bytes` column
that `fetch.sh` prints is authoritative.

PDFium URLs, one per platform:

- `https://github.com/bblanchon/pdfium-binaries/releases/download/chromium%2F8066/pdfium-linux-arm64.tgz`
- `https://github.com/bblanchon/pdfium-binaries/releases/download/chromium%2F8066/pdfium-mac-arm64.tgz`
- `https://github.com/bblanchon/pdfium-binaries/releases/download/chromium%2F8066/pdfium-linux-x64.tgz`

Model URLs: `https://github.com/docling-project/docling.rs/releases/download/models-v1/<file>`.

This is a deliberate subset of docling.rs's own `download_dependencies.sh`, and
it differs from that script in four ways:

- **Pinned PDFium.** The upstream script takes bblanchon's `releases/latest`,
  which is a moving target. This manifest uses `chromium/8066`. On Linux x64,
  upstream uses the `libpdfium.so` hosted in `models-v1` (its conformance
  build). We use bblanchon's `chromium/8066` there too, so that every platform
  has the same release line.
- **INT8 layout model only.** docling-pdf uses `layout_heron_int8.onnx`
  automatically when it is present and `DOCLING_LAYOUT_ONNX` is not set. The
  fp32 `layout_heron.onnx` (164 MB) is only needed when `DOCLING_RS_FP32=1`
  forces full precision, so it is not provisioned.
- **No extras.** There is no TableFormer (the `docling` backend runs with
  tables off), no multilingual OCR pair, no ASR, chunker, picture classifier or
  enrichment models.
- **One URL per file, no fallback mirrors.** Upstream falls back to Hugging
  Face, ModelScope or the PaddleOCR `main` branch when a release asset is
  missing. Those locations are mutable and would defeat the pin, so here a
  missing asset fails the run and names the URL.

### ONNX Runtime

ONNX Runtime is not in the manifest. docling-pdf depends on the `ort` crate
(2.0.0-rc.13) with the `download-binaries` feature. At build time, the `ort-sys`
build script downloads a prebuilt ONNX Runtime for the target, so building with
`--features docling` needs network access once. The Native workflow caches
`target/`, and the paths where `ort-sys` is expected to keep its download
cache, so rebuilds reuse it.

Not verified offline:

- which ONNX Runtime version and URL `ort-sys` fetches;
- whether it links statically or ships a dylib next to the binary;
- where its cache lives.

Check the build log of the first Native run for these. Pinning ONNX Runtime
(`ORT_LIB_LOCATION` or equivalent, with a hash) is a follow-up.

## Environment variables

| variable | meaning | default when unset |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PDFIUM_DYNAMIC_LIB_PATH` | absolute directory containing `libpdfium.{so,dylib}`, or the absolute library file itself | `pdfium`: the verified per-user install from `tpe-pdfium fetch`; full `docling`: required |
| `DOCLING_RS_MODELS_DIR` | the `.models` directory **itself** (not its parent). It is consulted for a `.models/<file>` path only when that path does not exist under the CWD | `.models/` under the CWD, then next to the executable and one level above it |
| `DOCLING_LAYOUT_ONNX`, `DOCLING_OCR_DET_ONNX`, … | per-file overrides from docling.rs; they bypass the resolver entirely | unset |
| `DOCLING_RS_FP32` | `1` forces the fp32 layout model, which is not provisioned here | unset |

The `pdfium` backend looks for the library in this order and never consults
the working directory:

1. `PDFIUM_DYNAMIC_LIB_PATH`, when set: an absolute directory or file, loaded as
   configured (relative paths are rejected).
2. The per-user install written by `tpe-pdfium fetch`
   (`$XDG_DATA_HOME/tpe/pdfium/<release>/<platform>/`, default
   `~/.local/share/...`; macOS `~/Library/Application Support/tpe/pdfium/...`;
   Windows `%LOCALAPPDATA%\tpe\pdfium\...`; `TPE_DATA_DIR` overrides the base).
   It is used only while the file's SHA-256 equals the digest pinned in
   `native/manifest.json`, which is compiled into the binary; a changed or
   corrupted file is ignored, not loaded.

```sh
cargo run --release --bin tpe-pdfium -- fetch   # ~3 MB download; verifies the archive and library digests
tpe-pdfium status                                # platform, pin, install path, what the backend would load
tpe extract paper.pdf --backend pdfium --db local.sqlite --out out/   # no environment variable needed
export PDFIUM_DYNAMIC_LIB_PATH="$(tpe-pdfium path)"   # only for tools that read the variable themselves (full docling)
```

`tpe-pdfium fetch` downloads the pinned bblanchon/pdfium-binaries archive over
HTTPS, refuses anything over 64 MB, checks the archive digest, extracts the
single pinned member in memory, checks the library digest, and installs it by
an atomic rename; on any mismatch nothing is installed. Until one of the two
locations is usable, every `pdfium` open fails with `pdfium library not found`
and names both remedies, and `tpe backends` reports the same; the binding
itself (pdfium-render 0.8, dynamic loading) needs nothing else. The `pdfium`
feature alone does not need the models; `sh native/fetch.sh --pdfium-only`
(about 8 MB) remains the repository-local alternative for CI and developers
who prefer `.pdfium/lib` plus the environment variable.

The resolution order comes from docling-core 1.69.2 (`assets.rs`) and
docling-pdf 1.69.2 (`pdfium_backend.rs`, `layout.rs`). Running `tpe` from the
repository root after `fetch.sh` needs an absolute `PDFIUM_DYNAMIC_LIB_PATH`.
CI sets both variables to absolute paths, so tests and `tpe` do not depend on
the CWD.

## Licences

| artifact | licence |
| --- | --- |
| PDFium | BSD-3-Clause (Google's PDFium licence), plus the notices of the third-party code it bundles (FreeType, libjpeg-turbo, zlib and others). bblanchon's archives include licence files. Check the tgz before redistributing: that was not verified offline |
| pdfium-binaries packaging | the bblanchon repository's own licence; not verified offline |
| `layout_heron_int8.onnx` | the docling.rs README says that the layout and TableFormer models are "PyTorch→ONNX exports of docling-project's own models (Apache-2.0 / CDLA-Permissive-2.0)" and points to its `docs/MODELS_NOTICE.md` for attribution. Which of the two licences covers which file was not verified offline |
| `ocr_det.onnx`, `ocr_rec_en.onnx`, `en_dict.txt` | re-hosted unmodified from PaddleOCR (PP-OCRv3 recognition and dictionary) and RapidOCR (PP-OCRv6 detector), per the docling.rs README. Their licence is not stated in the sources available offline: **unknown**, check upstream before redistributing |
| ONNX Runtime | fetched by `ort-sys`; licence not verified offline (upstream ONNX Runtime is MIT) |
| docling.rs crates | MIT |
| `pdfium-render`, `ort` crates | MIT OR Apache-2.0 |

None of these artifacts is committed to the repository. The `.models/` and
`.pdfium/` directories must stay out of git.

## Running locally (Apple Silicon, e.g. an M1)

```sh
sh native/fetch.sh                                   # about 82 MB of models plus PDFium; prints a table
# (or `sh native/fetch.sh --pdfium-only` for the `pdfium` feature without docling)
export PDFIUM_DYNAMIC_LIB_PATH="$PWD/.pdfium/lib"    # for docling; `pdfium` alone also works after `tpe-pdfium fetch`
cargo build --release --features docling,pdfium      # the first build downloads ONNX Runtime
cargo test --features docling,pdfium -- --nocapture  # native smoke tests must not print "skipped:"
# Full model-backed docling remains restricted to explicitly provisioned library/eval use.
# For supervised text parsing without native runtimes or models:
cargo build --release --features docling-text
./target/release/tpe extract paper.pdf --backend docling-text --db local.sqlite --out out/
```

The platform is detected from `uname`: `Darwin`/`arm64` maps to `mac-arm64`,
`Linux`/`aarch64` to `linux-arm64` and `Linux`/`x86_64` to `linux-x64`.
Intel Macs (`mac-x64`) have no manifest entry, so `fetch.sh` stops with an
error. To run the docling evaluation, follow [EVAL.md](EVAL.md) and add
`--backend docling`.

`fetch.sh` is idempotent. Files that are already present are not downloaded
again, but they are re-hashed on every run. Use `--force` to re-download
everything, `--pdfium-only` to skip the model entries, and `--print-hashes` to
hash what is on disk without touching the network.

## How hashes get pinned

Every manifest entry has `sha256`, the digest of the file at `dest`. PDFium
entries also have `archive_sha256`, the digest of the downloaded `.tgz`. Both
start as `null`:

1. A run with `null` hashes downloads, prints `file, bytes, sha256` (and
   `archive_sha256` for a fresh PDFium download) with the state
   `downloaded,unpinned`, and passes.
2. Copy the digests from the log of the `Provision PDFium and the docling
   models` step of a Native run on each platform into
   `native/manifest.json`. Each PDFium platform entry takes its own digests
   from the run on that platform. `linux-x64` has no CI leg, so pin it from a
   local run on such a host or leave it `null`. Commit the change on a branch
   and open a PR.
3. From then on, a mismatch fails the run and deletes a freshly downloaded
   file, and a cached file that no longer matches fails with a hint to rerun
   with `--force`.

Pinning a hash changes the manifest, and with it the `.models`/`.pdfium` cache
key, so the next run downloads fresh files and verifies them against the pins.
Changing a URL (a new PDFium release, a new models tag) works the same way:
edit the entry, reset its hashes to `null`, run the workflow, then pin.

The bounded Docling text module and remaining layout/OCR deployment requirements
are documented in [DOCLING.md](DOCLING.md).
